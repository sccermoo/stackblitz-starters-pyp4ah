  <p>All these items that ive listed are in my life or are important to me.</p>
  </h4>
  <p>God is the first becuase he is an important person in my life and a person i look up to, ive been trying my best to follow the path he gave me and in return i get his love and peace of life.</p>
    
    <p>then the sports soccer and volleyball, i enjoy them and im glad i started playting these sports becuase if i didn't i wouldnt be healthy and just be laying in my bed rotting away.
   <p> Benson high school is the school im going to for ninth grade and im pretty nervous about the classes and the work they'll assign but also i might join soccer or volleyball depending on how my grades are. </p>

    <p>Poetry is a writing that is a beautiful way to write words that have a deep or meaningful messages or stories. To me poetry is just a way i can express my feelings in different words that i can read and understand, i think personally that poetry is the best way to express your love to someone.</p>
